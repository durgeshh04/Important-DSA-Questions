-- Solution: 
-- Used a hashmap to store the count of each number and then used a heap to store the top k elements.
-- created a min heap and then added the elements to the heap and then popped the elements from the heap and added them to the result.
-- Time Complexity: O(nlogk)
-- Space Complexity: O(n)
